# Activity-2

In this repo, you will find the data for the assignment and an initial setup with an index-file together with a hello-world script using d3.js.

The data is the music-albums you already know, but they have been enriched with more data. 

On album-level:
   
    "rating": a value between 0-5 reprsenting the rating of the album, where 5 is the highest,
    "fullPlays": the number of times this album has been plays in its full,
    "favorites": number of users (asuming this is an online platform, where users are listening to music).

On track-level:

        "timesPlayed": the number of times this track has been played,
        "likes": how many likes this track has been given,
        "trackFavorites": how many users have this track as a favorite.

Building on your current knowledge, create a webpage that presents an overview of what you find "essential" stats on this online platform. 
Think of it as kind of dashboard, where a management-type of person can see what people are listening to.

You can use the data as it is or you may be able to derive new stats e.g.: by adding the likes of all tracks and dviving them with the number of tracks and use that as a metric for an "album-likes" to compliment the rating, maybe.

The values have been filled by an AI. Hence they are random and does not nescessarily reflect reality.

Use your creativity and see how much you are able to do here, there are no set answers.

Enjoy :)
